The app is compiled with [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

To build this app, you need to [download Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and install it.

If you are building for `Windows`, you should also [install and configure](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) `Visual Studio`.

If you are building for `Android`, you should also [install and configure](https://developer.android.com/studio) `Android Command Line Tools`.

If you are building for `iOS/iPadOS`, you should also [install and configure](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/xcode/id497799835) `Xcode`.

Run the command

flutter pub global activate intl_utils
dart run intl_utils:generate
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

and then  `flutter run [ios/android]` to start the app.
