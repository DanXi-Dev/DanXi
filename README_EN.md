# Maintenance Notice

As the Flutter framework has shown incompatibility, instability, and low performance in our
development, DanXi-Dev officially decided to abandon Flutter and move to Android and iOS native
development on July 20, 2022.

This repository will only be updated for maintenance purposes. You can browse new
repository [here (for Android)](https://github.com/DanXi-Dev/DanXi-NG)
and [here (for iOS, not public for secure reasons)](https://github.com/DanXi-Dev/DanXi-Swift).
