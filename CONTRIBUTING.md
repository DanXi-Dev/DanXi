# Contributing to Danta

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Above all, Danta (or 旦挞) is the source part of an application hosted by Github. We do not want to set a lot of guidelines or something else, just judge your contribution by your heart! ;)  

## :+1: What we love to see
- Codes linted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), or similar tools provided by your IDE
- Nice attitude to any issues you met with

**To be specific, we like:**

- No duplicate code block
- No confusing name for variables, methods and classes
- No lengthy and multi-function method body
- Decoupling is better than coupling
- Long but informative names are better than short but perplexing ones
- Numerous but small classes are better than few but very large ones
- Private is better than public. Use `_` in your naming as much as possible! 
- **A compliant commit message!** Quick flashback:
```
<action>: <description>

<details>
```

`<action>` shall be one of:
- `feat`: Implement new features.
- `fix`: Fix real bugs in the code. This means that corrections to documents, spelling, etc., do not count as fixes.
- `docs`: Changes to documentation (not include translation texts).
- `update`: Update translation texts.
- `upgrade`: Upgrade dependency, Flutter SDK version, etc.
- `change` / `misc`: Changes to the code that cannot be categorized. For example, modifying the color of a button or adjusting the layout boundaries.
- `style`: Changes to the code style, such as running the formatting tools, fixing typos, modifying variable names, removing unnecessary whitespace, etc.
- `refactor`: Refactor the code logic, without adding new features or fixing bugs.
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tool scripts.
- `perf`: Improve runtime performance.

There are also some other common actions, such as `add`, but they are discouraged in this project because they have been subdivided into other action types, such as `feat`.


## :-1: What we dislike to see
- Confusing codes or messy format
- Inappropriate attitude to bugs and discussions

Just have a cup of coffee :coffee: and start your first contribution. Take it easy!
