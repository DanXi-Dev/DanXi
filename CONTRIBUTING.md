# Contributing to DanXi

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Above all, DanXi(or Danxi, 旦夕) is the source part of an application hosted by Github. We do not want to set a lot of guidelines or something else, just judge your contribution by your heart! ;)  

## :+1: What we love to see
- Codes linted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), or similar tools provided by your IDE
- Nice attitude to any issues you met with

**To be specific, we like:**

- No duplicate code block
- No confusing name for variables, methods and classes
- `get` for getting something locally, `load` for getting something remotely, `save` for setting something locally
- No lengthy and multi-function method body. Keep it under 10 lines if possible
- Decoupling is better than coupling
- Long but informative names are better than short but perplexing ones
- Numerous but small classes are better than few but very large ones
- Private is better than public. Use `_` in your naming as much as possible! 

## :-1: What we dislike to see
- Confusing codes or messy format
- Inappropriate attitude to bugs and discussions

Just have a cup of coffee :coffee: and start your first contribution. Take it easy!
